# Pseudocode

## What is pseudocode?

Pseudocode is fake code. It is written in human readable language like English so that anyone can understand the steps written.

## Why do we use pseudocode?

The steps are written in let's say plain English. So any developer can understand what the steps are. And then anyone can code the steps in either C++ or JavaScript or Python.

We can share logics using pseudocodes among developers so that programming language does not become a barrier while understanding the main logic.
